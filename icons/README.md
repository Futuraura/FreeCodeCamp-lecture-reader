# Icon Placeholders

The `icons/` directory should contain:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these from icon.svg using an SVG to PNG converter, or use any image editor.

For now, you can use any PNG images of the appropriate sizes. The extension will work without icons, but they'll appear as generic icons in the browser.

To generate icons from the SVG:

1. Open icons/icon.svg in a browser
2. Take screenshots at different sizes
3. Save as PNG files with correct dimensions
4. Or use an online tool like: https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
